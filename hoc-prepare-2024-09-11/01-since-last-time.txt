Teodor har done a tiny bit of work since last time.

- We can now run `bbslideshow` from a JVM REPL or a bb REPL

- I've got a JVM REPL running, and can run the babashka script on the side

  Reason: CIDER's testing functionality doesn't appear to work out of the box
  with a babashka REPL, so I suggest REPL + tests from a JVM REPL, and run the
  script on the side.
